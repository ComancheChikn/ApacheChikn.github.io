<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
LAM 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:5 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:9 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!<br>
<br>
LAM 5:17 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?<br>
<br>
LAM 5:21 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.<br>
<br>
LAM 5:22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.<br>
<br>
