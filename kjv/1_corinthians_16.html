<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
1COR 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:12 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:14 Let all your things be done with charity.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)<br>
<br>
1COR 16:16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.<br>
<br>
1COR 16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.<br>
<br>
