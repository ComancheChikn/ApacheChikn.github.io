PROV 3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:<br>
<br>
PROV 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br>
<br>
PROV 3:4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:<br>
<br>
PROV 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:<br>
<br>
PROV 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:<br>
<br>
PROV 3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.<br>
<br>
PROV 3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.<br>
<br>
