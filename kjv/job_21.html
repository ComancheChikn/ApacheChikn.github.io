JOB 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:16 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,<br>
<br>
JOB 21:30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?<br>
<br>
JOB 21:32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.<br>
<br>
JOB 21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<br>
<br>
