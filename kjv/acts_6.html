<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
ACTS 6:1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.<br>
<br>
ACTS 6:15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.<br>
