JOB 18:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 18:2 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?<br>
<br>
JOB 18:4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?<br>
<br>
JOB 18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:9 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.<br>
<br>
JOB 18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.<br>
