SONG 5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?<br>
<br>
SONG 5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?<br>
<br>
SONG 5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.<br>
<br>
SONG 5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.<br>
