<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
JOB 40:1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 40:2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 40:4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br>
<br>
JOB 40:7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br>
<br>
JOB 40:9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br>
<br>
JOB 40:10 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:12 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:13 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.<br>
<br>
JOB 40:24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.<br>
<br>
