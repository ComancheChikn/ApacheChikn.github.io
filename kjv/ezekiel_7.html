EZEK 7:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:2 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:3 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:4 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:6 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:9 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:23 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.<br>
<br>
EZEK 7:27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<br>
