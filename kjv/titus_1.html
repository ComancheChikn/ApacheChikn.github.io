<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
TIT 1:1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:4 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:<br>
<br>
TIT 1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:<br>
<br>
TIT 1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;<br>
<br>
TIT 1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.<br>
<br>
TIT 1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br>
