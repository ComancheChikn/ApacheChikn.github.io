<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
1COR 13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,<br>
<br>
1COR 13:5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<br>
<br>
1COR 13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<br>
<br>
1COR 13:7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.<br>
<br>
1COR 13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.<br>
