JOB 37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?<br>
<br>
JOB 37:19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.<br>
<br>
JOB 37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.<br>
