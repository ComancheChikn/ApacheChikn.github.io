<br>
2SAM 8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.<br>

<br>
2SAM 8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;<br>
<br>
2SAM 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;<br>
