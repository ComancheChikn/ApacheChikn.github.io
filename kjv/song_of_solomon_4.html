SONG 4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!<br>
<br>
SONG 4:11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,<br>
<br>
SONG 4:14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:<br>
<br>
SONG 4:15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.<br>
<br>
SONG 4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.<br>
