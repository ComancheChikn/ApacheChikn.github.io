1CHRON 24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,<br>

1CHRON 24:17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:20 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.<br>

1CHRON 24:24 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:25 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.<br>
<br>
1CHRON 24:31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.<br>
