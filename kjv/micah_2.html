<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size= "3">
MIC 2:1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:2 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:4 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?<br>
<br>
MIC 2:8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.<br>
<br>
MIC 2:13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.<br>
