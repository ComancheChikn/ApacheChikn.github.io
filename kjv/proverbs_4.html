PROV 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<br>
<br>
PROV 4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<br>
